                        For the final project in 235 Information Design, we were asked to work in groups of up to 4 people to create a website that addresses a topic that involves people, the environment, and technology.

                        Working with a friend, we chose to make a website about the invasive species around Still Creek in Burnaby and the possible solutions to dealing with the invasive species. We first had to gather information about the issue and the possible solutions, and present it to the class in a short presentation. Next, we began creating the initial mock-up and wireframes of the website. We then began creating the initial prototype of the website, which we also had to present to the class in another short presentation. After presenting the prototype, we then began working on the final website.

                        On issue we ran into was that certain divs and text boxes were not equal height. We initially tried fixing the issue using CSS, but we found that while we could adjust the heights, we would have to change them each time we added more content. After trying a few different options, we ended up using jQuery to match the heights of the text boxes and divs.
